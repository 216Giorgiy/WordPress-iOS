# Contributing to WordPress-iOS

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the app, we really appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, fixing bugs, submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the part of the app that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.  A screenshot is always helpful as well.

## Submitting code changes

We welcome Pull Requests for any new feature or bug fix that you'd like to contribute!  More details on our process can be found in the [Make WordPress Mobile handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/pathways/ios/), specifically [here](https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/pathways/ios/how-to-contribute/).

## Contribute to translations

We use a tool called GlotPress to manage translations. The WordPress-iOS GlotPress instance lives here: http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/apps/ios/dev. To add new translations or fix existing ones, create an account over at GlotPress and submit your changes over at the GlotPress site.
